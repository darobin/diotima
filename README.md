## Installation

Clone the repo and `npm install -g`.

## Usage

Before you use it, it needs to be set up with the right secrets. Diotima uses your platform's keychain system to
securely store and retrieve your secrets.

First, create a GitHub token with an account that has access to the BoD's org on GitHub, then:

```
diotima token YOUR_TOKEN
```

Second, get your W3C calendar URL (from an account that is invited to BoD events) and make sure to exclude cancelled
events, then:

```
diotima calendar CALENDAR_URL
```

You only need to do that once; afterwards you can generate an agenda any time with:

```
diotima agenda > path/to/agenda.md
```

## Conventions

The conventions that it understands are these, please use them:

- Issues in the board's repo or any committee repo that are labelled 'board agenda' get included in the agenda for the next meeting.
- Ideally those issues should also be labelled 'for discussion' or 'needs resolution' so that we can know what to expect.
- The title of the issue is used for the agenda entry, and the body is used for the description, please use those accordingly.
- If the issue is assigned to someone, that person will be listed as expected to lead the conversation.
